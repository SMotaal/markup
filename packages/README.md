# Experimental Packages

Experimentals lead to two types of packages:

1. One that abstracts a pattern conceived in the experiment.
2. One that builds on a concrete outputs of the experiment.

## Abstractional Packages

Those packages abstract away patterns conceived in the experiment to make it possible to resuse them elsewhere.

**pseu·dom**

Abstractional document composition without the actual DOM.

**@SMotaal/tokenizer**

A refactored tokenizer from earlier markup experiments.

## Concrete Packages

Those packages build on concrete outputs of the experiment to make it possible to build solutions reliably.

**es·pressions**

A runtime-optimized markup parsing tool for ECMAScript source texts.

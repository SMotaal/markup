# Parser

This parser is a simplified reimplementation of the [experimental markup parser][experimental-markup] design by Saleh Abdel Motaal.

[experimental-markup]: <https://smotaal.github.io/experimental/markup> "Semi-contextual parsing experiments, which fall somewhere between the scope of regular expressions and the more much more advanced realms of source code parsing."
